I stand my ground.


It’s face is finally in full view. Gnarled, burned flesh in a rough outline of a mocking smile. For a moment life seems to stand still. It speaks. The words feel ancient. Earthly. Like the bowls of hell are speaking directly through the flesh its pupetteering.


“You parents are dead. Their flesh rests in my bowels.”


I see the fresh blood stains on his mouth and know he speaks the truth.


“I can bring them back.” It states with a flat confidence.


“Would you like them back”?


------Ask for them to be revived------     ------ shoot him in the face -------


I ask for them to be revived.


“Only blood pays for blood”. THe sounds emanate from the burnt flesh without any visible signs of its mouth moving. A knife is produced from its cloak. I take the knife and press it to my arm. The cold steel bites in to my flesh and the red warmth comes down my arm. 


It’s nostrils flare. It places its burnt, fleshy mouth beneath the flowing blood.


My life is restored to me like nothing happened in the morning. The cost, however, will be great. 




--I  shoot him in the face ---


I point the gun directly at the center of the monstrosity and pull the trigger. Nothing happens . It looks it me as a stumbling puppy who tried to bite his master. Darkness fills my vision. “I tried mom and dad “, is my last thought as unconsciousness takes me.
